# NLP_Project
In this NLP project, I utilized the 'train.tsv' dataset to perform text preprocessing, tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, n-grams, part-of-speech tagging, and shallow parsing. I harnessed mathematical operations, visualized text, word clouds. I used XGBoost, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression models for sentiment classification
